# 04-TASK-Internship-Work-Oasis-Infobyte
Developed an Email Spam Detection model using Machine Learning techniques to classify emails as spam or not. Preprocessed data, applied feature extraction, and trained models like Naive Bayes and SVM. Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy and confusion matrix. Tools used: Python, Scikit-learn.

# Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning - Internship Project

## üìå Project Overview
This project was developed during my internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. The goal was to build a machine learning model to detect and classify spam emails from legitimate ones. The model was built using various machine learning techniques and datasets to improve accuracy in spam classification.

## üè¢ About Oasis Infobyte
**Oasis Infobyte** is a technology company that offers internship programs to students in the fields of Web Development, Data Science, Machine Learning, and more. The company emphasizes hands-on learning and real-world project experience, providing opportunities to develop technical and professional skills.

## üîç Problem Statement
The challenge was to classify emails into two categories:
- **Spam** (unwanted or junk emails)
- **Not Spam** (legitimate or important emails)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Loaded a publicly available dataset of emails labeled as spam or not spam.
   - Cleaned the data (removed stop words, punctuation, etc.) using NLP techniques.

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Converted emails into a format suitable for machine learning using techniques like TF-IDF and Count Vectorizer.

3. **Model Building**
   - Trained multiple machine learning models such as:
     - Naive Bayes
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Random Forest

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Applied grid search for tuning model hyperparameters to improve classification results.

## üìà Outcome
Achieved high accuracy in detecting spam emails using machine learning. The project provided hands-on experience in NLP, feature extraction, and model evaluation, enhancing my skills in Data Science and Machine Learning.

## üìÅ Dataset
The dataset used in this project was a publicly available collection of emails labeled as spam or not spam.

## üôå Acknowledgment
Thanks to **Oasis Infobyte** for providing the opportunity and mentorship throughout the internship, allowing me to gain practical experience in machine learning and data science.
